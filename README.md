# Notes and Accords, Quantifying Perfume's Ephemerality
This project explores the relationship between a perfume's fragrance notes and the subjective experience of its emergent accords using a variety of statistical methods including mutual information, principal component analysis, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and multiclass/multilabel classification. Given a perfume’s list of notes and concentrations, can the resulting accords be predicted? Can the target consumer (male, female, or both) be derived from the notes and accords? How does a perfume’s makeup influence its popularity? For example, if Channel were to create a new perfume targeted to men, which notes/accords should be selected to maximize sales?
